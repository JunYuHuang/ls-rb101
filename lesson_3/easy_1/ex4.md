# My Solution

The first method call `delete_at` removes the element at index `1` from the `numbers` array, i.e. the second element. The removed element is `2`. After the call, the array is mutated and its new value is `[1, 3, 4, 5]`.

The second method call `delete` removes all elements with value `1` from the `numbers` array. In this case, only the first element `1` is removed. After the call, the array is mutated and its new value is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`.
